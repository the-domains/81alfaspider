# Condition Of The Car

The car is in excellent condition - body, interior and mechanically.

As the photos show, there is virtually no rust on the car anywhere. The exception is a small spot on the right side rocker panel where it always is on these cars. It is so minor I have not taken any action on it yet, as the cure would be worse than the disease at this point.

The wheels are original, as is the top. Upholstery and carpeting throughout is original. The steering wheel is a smaller diameter padded leather aftermarket wheel installed by the original owner.

Cincinnati had emissions testing when we bought the car, so we put the air pump and other pollution equipment back on that the original owner had removed. The car did pass the Ohio emissions testing.

The radiator fan has been replaced with an electric fan, and the thermostatic actuator has been replaced by a fixed position dummy actuator to keep the car in warm running mode.

The car starts and runs well. I don't go zooming hard cornering these days, but I do run it on local roads up to 55 or 60 mph.
