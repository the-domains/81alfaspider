## Thank you 

for taking the time to check out our Alfa. As you see, it is in great condition, it starts, runs and looks pretty much as it did when purchased by the original owner. I am the second owner, since 1987\. It has been garaged all of it's life.

Feel free to contact me via carey{at}parkswhistles.com or 432-363-5883 if you have any questions or to arrange to see the car if you in striking distance of Cape Coral, FL. 

Valuation - [Check the Hagerty website][0].

Please click on any photos you would like to see in their original size and color. The web site likes to get creative and mess with the colors and cropping. Seriously! I don't do that, "thegrid" does. (Check out [thegrid.io][1])

If all you want to do is look through the photos of the car, click [HERE][2].
