description: "Thank you for taking the time to check our car. As you will see, it is in great condition, it starts, runs and looks pretty much as it did when purchased by the original owner. I am the second owner, and bought it in 1987. It has been garaged all of it's life, so the typical rust you might find on other Spiders is absent from this car.\_"

Thank you for taking the time to check our car. As you will see, it is in great condition, it starts, runs and looks pretty much as it did when purchased by the original owner. I am the second owner, and bought it in 1987\. It has been garaged all of it's life, so the typical rust you might find on other Spiders is absent from this car. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/06feaa76-6fbe-490a-90ea-59ea45b17b6b.jpg)

Feel free to contact me via carey{at}parkswhistles.com or 432-363-5883 if you have any questions or to arrange to see the car if you in striking distance of Cape Coral, FL. 

Please click on any photos you would like to see in their original size and color. The web site likes to get creative and mess with the colors and cropping. Seriously! I don't do that, "thegrid" does. (Check out [thegrid.io][0])

If all you want to do is look through the photos of the car, click HERE.
