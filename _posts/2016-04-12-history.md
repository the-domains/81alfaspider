# The History Of The Car

The car was purchased in Colorado by a fellow in the Air Force who moved to Columbus, OH where we bought the car. He installed a Ward and Dean competition suspension, sump guard, and roll bar to improve the handling of the car. While he owned the car, the special edition blue metallic paint began to craze and Alfa agreed to pay for repainting the car as original. The original owner gave me a 35mm slide showing the body of the car in bare metal on a dolly in a restoration shop after having been dipped to remove all original paint. I am still looking for that slide after moving to Florida.

The repaint was very professionally done, and I credit the repaint with the lack of rust on the car today. The paint exactly matches the Alfa touch-up paint, and all factory stickers were put back on the car after painting. Tar-like undercoatings were the rage back then, and the car was sprayed to further protect it from rust.

Not long after we bought the car in 1987 the speedometer stopped working, with around 38,000 miles on it. I replaced it with a used one showing just over 87,000 miles. With 93,650 miles showing today that means we have put less than 6000 miles on the car while we have owned it.

In 2005 I replaced the little rubber hose that connects the submersible pump to the output pipe of the fuel tank.

In 2011 I replaced the alternator.

In 2016 I replaced the starter and all the things internal to the fuel tank. All filters and fluids were changed at the time as well. The tank was removed, cleaned with acid and coated with POR-15 for a permanent seal against future rusting. The starter was changed in 2015, and the clutch slave cylinder in 2016\. The fuel tank was removed, cleaned and sealed in 2015, and all the rubber hoses were replaced with new silicone hoses. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/7c3f5cd7-44b4-44d0-b8c8-4173f91da1d2.jpg)

The Thermostatic Actuator stopped working years ago, in the beginning of 2016 I replaced the plunger on the Spica pump with a dummy to keep the pump in normal warm running mode. This makes starting the car for the first time in the day a little tricky, but it runs much better leaned out as intended when warm. The Thermostatic Actuator can be replaced with a new unit from Centerline International for $329 if you are so inclined. I find the car runs fine here in Florida the way it is.

While we owned it, the car was always garaged and never driven in the rain. It was trailered from Cincinnati to Cape Coral when we moved.
