Thank you 

for taking the time to check out our Alfa. As you see, it is in great condition, it starts, runs and looks pretty much as it did when rolled off the dealer's lot. I am the second owner, since 1987\. It has been garaged all of it's life. (Click the pics to see full size and original color.) ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/77bce7d5-f1f3-4ff9-a47c-ab762cd8749b.jpg)

Feel free to contact me via carey{at}parkswhistles.com or 432-363-5883 if you have any questions or to arrange to see the car if you are in striking distance of Cape Coral, FL.
