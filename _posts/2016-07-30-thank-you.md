  Thank you for taking the time to check out our Alfa. As you see, it is in
  great condition, it starts, runs and looks pretty much as it did when rolled
  off the dealer's lot. I am the second owner, since 1987. It has been garaged
  all of it's life. (Click the pics to see full size and original color.)
